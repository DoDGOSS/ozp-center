# React JS Template App

This is a starter template [based on](https://github.com/johnthethird/react-starter-template) for building your first [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) application. Based on a [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) build system. If you look at the /gulp, it implements some nifty features:

* `gulp` shows all available commands.
* `gulp dev` implements an http server and a live reload server.
* `gulp --production` shows how to use command line flags to switch to building minified versions.
* Uses the awesome Webpack project to combine all the javascript files into one.

## Getting Started
First clone the repo...

`git clone https://github.com/nishp1/react-starter-template.git`

Then install the bower and npm modules

```
npm install
```

`npm start` or `gulp dev` then go to http://localhost:4000

Your browser will automatically reload when any file in /app changes.
